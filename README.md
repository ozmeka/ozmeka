# ozmeka
This is a project to adapt Omeka 2 for use in eResearch, mainly in the Australian context. 

Project goals include:
* Adapting Omeka 2 to support cross-disciplinary research data collections. Eg:
  * [Dharmae](http://dharmae.research.uts.edu.au/) Data hub of Australian Research on Marine and Acquatic Ecocultures (NOTE: this is still not in its released form)
  * [From Farms to Freeways](http://omeka.uws.edu.au/farmstofreeways/) (NOTE: not using Ozmeka code but this is the kind of collection we want to support).
* Making Omeka 2 as linked-data compliant as possible by improving ItemRelations, and making sure that URIs are used in as many places as possible rather than scalar-values such as strings.

This repository is a place-holder which will have wiki pages, milestones and issues, but may not have any code.
