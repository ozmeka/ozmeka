# ozmeka
This is a project to adapt Omeka 2 for use in eResearch, mainly in the Austrailan context. 

Project goals include:
* Adapting Omeka to support cross-disciplinary research data collections (TODO: @sharynys expand)
* Making Omeka 2 as linked-data compliant as possible by improving ItemRelations, and making sure that URIs are used in as many places as possible.

This repository is a place-holder which will have wiki pages, milestones and issues, but may not have any code.
